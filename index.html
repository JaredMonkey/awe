  	<h3>Description:</h3>
	Join Adrian Biedrzycki (CEO Exokit Inc.), Jared Cheshier (CTO Pluto VR), and  Forest Gibson (Director of Labs Pluto VR) for a A joint report around the state of multi-user, multi-app spatial computing. They'll discuss what it means to be virtually co-present while operating multiple applications in spatial computing, how applications might interact with each other across different VR systems, development of standards to facilitate interoperability, and what historical technological transitions can be looked back upon for inspiration and lessons.
	<h3>How to join:</h3>
